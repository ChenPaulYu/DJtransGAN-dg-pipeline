## Overview

The repo is under construction. We split the full implementation into five parts and plan to release it one by one in the future. These parts include 

1. Differentiable DJ mixer includes differentiable fader and differentiable equalizer in the time-frequency domain 
    - [x] differentiable fader
    - [x] differentiable equalizer
    - [x] differentiable mixer
2. DJTransGAN architecture and its training code 
    - [ ] GAN model architecture
    - [ ] GAN training code
3. DJTransGAN pre-trained model and its inference code
    - [ ] GAN pre-trained model
    - [ ] GAN inference code
4. Data generation pipeline includes four-step usually applied by DJ to select appropriate cue points and matched tracks. 
    - [ ] music structure segmentation
    - [ ] mixablity estimation and pairing
    - [ ] bpm and key alignment
    - [ ] cue point selection
5. Documentation

## Dataset

We collected two datasets to train our proposed approaches: DJ mixset from [Livetracklist](https://www.livetracklist.com/) and individual EDM tracks from [MTG-Jamendo-Dataset](https://github.com/MTG/mtg-jamendo-dataset). 

To be more specific, We in-house collect long DJ mixsets from Livetracklist and only consider the mixset with mix tag to ensure the quality of the mixset. Furthermore, we select the individual EDM track from MTG-Jamendo-Dataset, which means the track with an EDM tag in the total collection. The detailed information about using these two datasets to train our model is described in Section 3.1; please check it if you are interested. 

Last, we can not provide our training dataset for reproducing our results because of the license issues. However, we will release our training code and pre-trained model in the future to make it more applicable. if you have any other suggestions, please let me know.
